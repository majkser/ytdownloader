YouTube Downloader with Tkinter GUI
This Python project is a simple YouTube downloader that allows users to download either audio or video from YouTube. The script uses the yt-dlp library to handle the download and supports both video and audio formats. It uses Tkinter to create a GUI for easy interaction.

Features

Installation
To use this downloader, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries. Follow the steps below to set it up:

1. Install Python
Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Required Libraries
This project requires yt-dlp (a fork of youtube-dl) and tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python). Install yt-dlp using pip:

bash
Skopiuj kod
pip install yt-dlp
3. Running the Project
After installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the script as follows:

bash
Skopiuj kod
python <name_of_script.py>
4. Interface
When you run the script, it will prompt you to choose whether you want to download a video or audio from YouTube. After that, you will be asked to provide the URL of the video or audio you want to download. The download will proceed automatically based on your selection.

Example:
less
Skopiuj kod
Do you want to download a video or audio? (enter 'video' or 'audio'): video
Enter the URL of the video you want to download: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdefg
Once the URL is entered, the selected file (either video or audio) will be downloaded to your current working directory.

Code Explanation
User Input:

The script first asks the user whether they want to download a video or audio.
Then, it asks for the URL of the media to download.
Options Configuration:

If the user selects "video," the script prepares the download options for video (MP4 format).
If the user selects "audio," it configures the download for audio (M4A format).
yt-dlp Integration:

yt-dlp is used to fetch and download the media from the provided URL.
The script automatically detects and applies the download options based on the user's choice.
File Naming:

The downloaded file is named according to the title of the media (video or audio).
Usage Example
bash
Skopiuj kod
$ python downloader.py
